# Semantic Checker(DocMatch)

This project is a simple but powerful AI tool that compares two clauses both are taken as input from the user to check if they mean the same thing, even if they’re written differently.

It’s a small part of a bigger idea called **DocMatch**, which aims to automate and simplify compliance checking in government bidding processes.

# What It Does:-

- Takes two text inputs:  
- Uses AI to understand and compare their meaning
- Returns a **semantic similarity score** (between 0 and 1)
- Tells whether it’s a:
  -  Full Match
  -  Partial Match
  -  No Match
